# DDEV Drupal Experience Builder Development Environment

This creates and configures a DDEV project for local Drupal [Experience Builder](https://www.drupal.org/project/experience_builder) (XB) module development. Specifically, it creates a Drupal site, clones and installs the module, sets up the front-end dependencies, and provides Cypress JavaScript testing functionality.

This creates a new project from scratch; it cannot be added to an existing DDEV project. It has not been tested, but it is probably destructive and will certainly fail. (Don't try.)

>  **Notice:** This add-on is experimental. See [Support & community](#support--community) below.

## Requirements

### DDEV

Obviously, this requires a working [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) installation.

### Docker provider
This has been successfully tested with Orbstack, Colima, and Docker Desktop. Colima and Docker Desktop work out-of-the-box. Orbstack requires one change:

#### Orbstack

Override the default `$DISPLAY` environment variable in the container by adding the following to your `.ddev/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
web_environment:
  - DISPLAY=host.orb.internal:0
```

### XQuartz

The XQuartz X Window System is required for Cypress testing on macOS. You can skip this step if you do not intend to run Cypress--if you only plan to do backend development or user testing, for example. You can return to it later if you change your mind.

> **Note:** Carefully follow the below Cypress configuration steps after installing it. Failure to do so will result in frustrating, difficult to debug problems.

Install Cypress using Homebrew. See also https://www.xquartz.org/.

```shell
brew install xquartz
```

Configure XQuartz to allow connections from the host:

- Open XQuartz.
- Open Preferences ("XQuartz" > "Settings..." from the menu or `âŒ˜,`).
- Go to the "Security" tab.
- Check the "Allow connections from network clients" checkbox.
- Log out and back in or restart your machine for the change to take effect.

## Installation

```shell
# Create a new directory for your new DDEV project.
# This can be any place you like. For example:
mkdir ~/Sites/xb-dev
cd ~/Sites/xb-dev

# Configure the new project.
ddev config --project-type=drupal --php-version=8.3 --docroot=web

# Get the add-on. It will do the rest.
# Expect this step to take ten minutes or more, including a long period without output.
ddev get TravisCarden/ddev-drupal-xb-dev
```

## Usage

The resulting DDEV project is just like any other one. Interact with it using the [the built-in commands](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/usage/commands/), e.g., `ddev launch` to browse the site.

The installation process clones [the Experience Builder module](https://www.drupal.org/project/experience_builder) into `web/modules/contrib/experience_builder` and places an `experience_builder` symlink to it at the project root for convenient access. Develop and contribute from either location like you would any other Git repo for a normal Drupal project.

### Browsing and development

To browse the site, run:

```shell
ddev launch
```

To log into Drupal, run:

```shell
ddev drush uli
```

To clean-install the module's UI app, i.e., rebuild its front-end assets, run the following. Do this whenever you pull upstream changes to the module.

```shell
ddev xb-npm-ci
```

### Cypress

Cypress testing is currently only supported on macOS. Make sure you have installed and carefully configured XQuartz per [the instructions above](#xquartz).

To run the tests interactively, use `ddev xb-cypress-open`:

```shell
ddev xb-cypress-open
```

To run them headlessly, use `ddev xb-cypress-run`:

```shell
ddev xb-cypress-run                             # Run all tests.
ddev xb-cypress-run --spec "e2e/*.cy.js"        # Run all end-to-end tests.
ddev xb-cypress-run --spec "e2e/canary.cy.js"   # Run a specific test.
```

## Updating

Update the XB module clone just like you would any other Git repo. No tools are currently provided for updating Core or reinstalling the site.

## FAQ & known issues

### Can I use Cypress on Linux or Windows?

No, not currently; and there are no plans at present to support it. See [Support & community](#support--community) above if you want to make a case for it.

### What if Cypress fails to start?

If you get an error like the below when attempting to run Cypress on macOS...

- Confirm that you have carefully followed _all_ the instructions under [Cypress](#cypress).
- If you're using Orbstack, take [the special steps outlined above](#orbstack).

If these don't resolve the issue, see [Support & community](#support--community) above.

```
Cypress failed to start.

This may be due to a missing library or dependency. https://on.cypress.io/required-dependencies

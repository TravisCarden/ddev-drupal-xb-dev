# DDEV Drupal Experience Builder Development Environment

This creates and configures a DDEV project for local Drupal [Experience Builder](https://www.drupal.org/project/experience_builder) (XB) module development. Specifically, it creates a Drupal site, clones and installs the module, sets up the front-end dependencies, and provides Cypress JavaScript testing functionality.

These instructions create a new project from scratch. The add-on cannot be added to an existing DDEV project. It _can_ be updated in the usual way by simply running `ddev get TravisCarden/ddev-drupal-xb-dev`.

>  **Notice:** This add-on is experimental. See [Support & community](#support--community) below.

## Requirements

### DDEV

Obviously, this requires a working [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) installation.

### Docker provider
This has been successfully tested with Orbstack, Colima, Rancher Desktop, and Docker Desktop. Colima and Docker Desktop work out-of-the-box.

### XQuartz

The XQuartz X Window System is required for Cypress testing on macOS. You can skip this step if you do not intend to run Cypress--if you only plan to do backend development or user testing, for example. You can return to it later if you change your mind.

> **Note:** Carefully follow the below Cypress configuration steps after installing it. Failure to do so will result in frustrating, difficult to debug problems.

Install Cypress using Homebrew. See also https://www.xquartz.org/.

```shell
brew install xquartz
```

Configure XQuartz to allow connections from the host:

- Open XQuartz.
- Open Preferences ("XQuartz" > "Settings..." from the menu or `âŒ˜,`).
- Go to the "Security" tab.
- Check the "Allow connections from network clients" checkbox.
- Log out and back in or restart your machine for the change to take effect.

## Installation

```shell
# Create a new directory for your new DDEV project.
# This can be any place you like. For example:
mkdir ~/Sites/xb-dev
cd ~/Sites/xb-dev

# Configure the new DDEV project.
ddev config --project-type=drupal --php-version=8.3 --docroot=web

# Create the Drupal project.
ddev composer create drupal/recommended-project:^11.x-dev --no-install

# Install the add-on.
ddev get TravisCarden/ddev-drupal-xb-dev

# Perform one-time setup operations.
ddev xb-setup
```

## Usage

The resulting DDEV project is just like any other one. Interact with it using the [the built-in commands](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/usage/commands/), e.g., `ddev launch` to browse the site.

The installation process clones [the Experience Builder module](https://www.drupal.org/project/experience_builder) into `web/modules/contrib/experience_builder`. Develop and contribute from either location like you would any other Git repo for a normal Drupal project.

### Browsing and development

To browse the site, run:

```shell
ddev launch
```

To log into Drupal, run:

```shell
ddev drush uli
```

To clean-install and build the module's UI app assets, run the following. Do this whenever you pull upstream changes to the module.

```shell
ddev xb-npm-build
```

To completely reinstall Drupal and the Experience Builder module, run:

```shell
ddev xb-drush-si
```

### Cypress

Cypress testing is currently only supported on macOS. Make sure you have installed and carefully configured XQuartz per [the instructions above](#xquartz).

Run tests interactively:

```shell
ddev xb-cypress-open
```

Run them headlessly:

```shell
ddev xb-cypress-run
```

Run component/unit tests:

```shell
ddev xb-cypress-component
```

## Updating

Update the XB module clone just like you would any other Git repo. No tools are currently provided for updating Core or reinstalling the site.

## FAQ & known issues

### Can I use Cypress on Linux or Windows?

No, not currently; and there are no plans at present to support it. See [Support & community](#support--community) above if you want to make a case for it.

### What if Cypress fails to start?

If you get an error like the below when attempting to run Cypress on macOS...

- Confirm that you have carefully followed _all_ the instructions under [Cypress](#cypress).
- See if your [Docker provider](#docker-provider) above requires any special configuration.

If these don't resolve the issue, see [Support & community](#support--community) above.

```
Cypress failed to start.

This may be due to a missing library or dependency. https://on.cypress.io/required-dependencies

Please refer to the error below for more details.

### What if I get an HTTPS error?

If this is your first time using DDEV, you may get an error like the following when you try to visit your site. If so, you need to configure your OS and browser to trust the root certificate authority that DDEV uses. See [DDEV Installation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/ddev-installation/).
